          <h1>Red</h1>
          <p>Red personality types are dynamic and driven individuals. They have goals in life that others may have difficult reaching,
          partly because the goals are near impossible set, but also because they always strive forward, always push themselves harder, and almost never give up.
          People with a lot of red personality are very result-oriented, extroverted, and likes to take on challenges. A common trait among red types is that they
          tend to rather outspoken, saying it exactly how it is. Red types usually firmly stand behind what they believe, hard to buldge from their standpoint 
          unless they themselves change their mind on their own. And least but perhaps biggest feature of red types is their need for competivness, always in the 
          need to be the best in whatever they are currently interested in.
